    <p>Off the court, Curry is known for his philanthropy and business ventures. He has been involved in numerous charitable efforts, including his "Nothing But Nets" campaign to fight malaria and his Stephen and Ayesha Curry Family Foundation, which works on educational initiatives, empowering youth, and other humanitarian efforts.
